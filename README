This project is an usb to other bus program. This program is devided into two parts, one is the driver for Linux/Windows and the other is for MCU which has an usb-device usb port and other bus(e.g. I2C,UART,SPI,GPIO). When this MCU is connected with Linux(ARM/X86 machine) or Windows with usb bus then the driver of this project is loaded and treated as the MCU-side bus(e.g. I2C,UART,SPI,GPIO).The codes for MCU which is the core logic of this bus converter is provided,repectively.
